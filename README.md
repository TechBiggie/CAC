Introduction
The Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) of Nigeria plays an important role in regulating business operations in the country, ensuring transparency and accountability through compliance with statutory requirements. One such requirement is the annual return fee, which every registered company must pay to maintain an active status in the corporate registry. The annual return fee is meant to update the CAC on the company’s status, including its financial position, shareholding structure, and overall operations.

Recently, the CAC released a list of companies that have failed to file their annual returns for over a decade, leading to their potential delisting. This report provides a detailed analysis of the data made available, including the financial implications and patterns in non-compliance, offering insights into the trends and disparities observed.

Methodology
The analysis is based on the data provided by the CAC and includes an examination of annual return fees over a 10-year period.

Since the document provided by the CAC did not specify the average return fee for Limited Liability Companies, they were categorized into two groups: small companies and not small companies. The average annual return fee was used for limited companies (₦2,500.00).

To better understand patterns, the years of registration for the companies were grouped into 10-year intervals, starting from the 1900s up to the 2010s. This helped identify trends in delisting over time.

To identify inconsistencies, we examined discrepancies between the years provided in the dataset and the public search portal on the CAC website.

Insights were derived by analyzing the proportion of inactive versus active companies, the distribution of delisted companies by decades, and differences between Limited Liability Companies and Public Liability Companies.

Key Insights
The total number of companies identified was 80,429, with a total annual return fee (for 10 years, excluding late filings) estimated at ₦2.01 billion.

The year of registration for the companies ranged from 1900 to 2013. Delisted Companies were highest for the 1980s, totaling 25,856 (32.15% of the delisted companies), followed by the 1990s and 1970s. Across all 12 decade groups, delisted companies ranged from as few as 8 to as many as 25,856. Significant discrepancies were observed between the years provided in the CAC document and those available on the public search portal of the CAC website, indicating potential data quality issues.

Limited Liability Companies (80,324) significantly outnumbered Public Liability Companies (105), accounting for 99.87% of all companies.

The average annual return fee for Limited Liability Companies was ₦25,000.00, while Public Liability Companies had an average return fee of ₦50,000.00 over the 10-year period.

Inactive companies (80,424) were overwhelmingly higher than active companies (5), with inactive companies accounting for 99.99% of the total.

Conclusion
The findings highlight critical trends and financial implications for companies that failed to comply with the CAC’s annual return requirements. The high number of inactive companies, significant delistings from the 1980s, and disparities in data underscore the need for improved compliance mechanisms and data management practices. The CAC’s efforts to enforce compliance are vital to maintaining the integrity and functionality of Nigeria’s corporate environment.
